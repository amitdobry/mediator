It will never be supported on IE. There are limitations with iOS too.
https://caniuse.com/#search=getusermedia
For the other browsers it will depend on which features you are using and which browser specifically.

Thank you for creating such great code! I have one question: what would you have to do to save the recorded video to an external platform/source?

Instead of just setting the video.src with the Object URL, set the href of an anchor tag to that value and then adding the download attribute to that anchor tag will let you. save the video locally.
If you want it on a server then you can use fetch to upload the Blob. This video should help - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtKIcqZdLLM

Would it be the same for saving it to a drive such as BOX? If you don't mind would you kindly show an example/demonstration code for this? I have been trying to figure this out for the past few days and still not made much progress. I watched the video, but I am still confused as I am brand new to coding. Ideally, I just need the recorded webcam video to get saved directly to a drive through a button press, so it avoids the user doing much from their side.
Thank you in advance!

If you were using an online service like OneDrive or Box or Dropbox then you would need to use their API instead of writing your own server-side script to manage the uploaded files. I do not have any tutorials or samples for this.

Sorry. Not looking for any contract work right now. My schedule is very full.

No sir....I didn't mean contact work....I just want assistance in one topic.

I am working on a project using liveness detection and photo verify.

However , if you are busy I appreciate that as well.

Thank you for your reply.

Hi, thank you for the great code! I'm having an issue where the file that downloads only plays audio (no video) despite being an mp4 file. The video captured is viewable in the browser, but upon downloading, the visual aspect disappears completely. Is there a way to remedy this?

Thanks for the help!
