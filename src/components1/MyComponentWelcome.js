            <ul class="silver-background">

              <li>Just like a real proffesional mediator, Eliezer mediates your buisness conflict, using a unique "take turns talking" live session, with you and your partner\ex-partner.</li>

              <li>both sides will explain the problem subjectivly, and each of there solution offer, while the other is passivly listening, able to comment any time, without realy interupting the speaker. so both sides have their opertunity to give their opinion on the matter.</li>

              <li>papu will ask the question, papu will be adressed with both sides answers, and onces session is done, if both sides havnt found a solution, the recorded session will be availiable to be judged by a real objective mediator, or the recorded session will be available to download by both sides to send to a mediator independantly.</li>

              <li>part 2 will be a direct conversation between the two rivals, with a special debating system lead by papu, to make sure every word is really listened to, and every thougt really considered, using the "traffic-brain" method</li>

              <li>part 3 is where you sign the glorius paper, where both sides accept turm, and shake in the settlmented sheet of paper</li>

              <li>eliezer papu, could also be sat by a reallife mediator from the top of the shelve, ready to give his heart and mind to your sake onboard with you at the session, giving his honest oppinion, live, at the appointed meeting.</li>
